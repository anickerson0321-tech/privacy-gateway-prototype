# Forkful: a ReciMe-style recipe app

Forkful is an installable web app (PWA) that copies ReciMe's core features. You can save recipes from social media and websites, cook step by step, plan the week, and shop from a grocery list sorted by aisle. There's no build step, no backend and no account. Everything runs in the browser and is saved on the device.

## Features

| ReciMe feature | Forkful |
| --- | --- |
| Import from Instagram / TikTok / YouTube / Facebook / Pinterest / websites | Paste a link, or share it to the installed app (Android share target). Recipe sites are read from their schema.org data. TikTok and YouTube captions are parsed into ingredients and steps. Public Facebook posts are read through Facebook's embed page. |
| When a link can't be read | **Find a matching recipe** searches a free recipe database by dish name and shows photos, so you can pick the one that looks like the post. The original link is kept in the recipe's notes. There's also a Google search button and a box to paste the recipe link you find. Search is also available from the ＋ menu as **Find by dish name**. |
| Import from captions & notes | Paste any text. The parser finds the title, servings, times, ingredients, steps and hashtags, even in one-line captions. |
| Scan recipes from photos | Text is read on the device with Tesseract.js, then parsed the same way as pasted text. |
| Recipe library & cookbooks | Search across titles, ingredients and tags. Sort by recent, A–Z, quickest or most cooked. Includes favorites and custom cookbooks with emoji covers. |
| Recipe page | Change servings, switch between original, US and metric units, tick off ingredients you have, rate the recipe, add notes and log each time you cook it. |
| Cook mode | One step per screen, with swipe and arrow-key navigation. Each step shows the ingredients it uses. Durations in a step become timer buttons. The screen stays awake (Wake Lock). |
| Timers | Several timers can run at once in a floating tray. When one ends you get a sound, vibration and a notification. |
| Nutrition | Uses the source's nutrition data when available. Otherwise it's estimated per serving from the ingredient list. |
| Meal planner | Weekly calendar with breakfast, lunch, dinner and snack slots, plus free-text notes. One tap adds the week's ingredients to the grocery list. |
| Grocery list | Matching items are merged with unit conversion (2 tbsp + 1 cup butter = 1⅛ cups). Items are grouped by aisle or by recipe. You can check items off, share the list and add items by hand. |
| Discover | A built-in feed of recipes with categories and a recipe of the day. |
| Offline & install | A service worker caches the app shell. It can be installed to the home screen on iOS and Android. |
| Backup | Export or import all data as JSON. Supports light and dark themes. |

## Run it

```bash
# from the repository root
python3 -m http.server 8000
# open http://localhost:8000/recime/
```

The app uses ES modules, so it has to be served over HTTP. Opening `index.html` straight from disk won't work. On `main`, the existing GitHub Pages workflow publishes it at `/<repo>/recime/`.

## Tests

```bash
node --test recime/tests/parse.test.mjs
```

The tests cover ingredient parsing, scaling, unit and temperature conversion, durations and timers, caption parsing, schema.org extraction, aisle sorting, grocery merging and the nutrition estimate.

## Notes and limits

- **Link imports need a relay for most sites.** Most sites don't allow a browser page on another domain to read them (CORS), so the app first tries a direct fetch. If that fails, it tries three free public services at the same time (`r.jina.ai`, `api.codetabs.com`, `api.allorigins.win`) and uses whichever answers first. These services only see the link being imported. You can turn this off under **Profile → Import helper**.
- **Facebook and Instagram usually need a login** to show a post, so many of their links can't be read by any app. For those, use **Find a matching recipe** or **Paste the caption instead**.
- **Recipe search** uses [TheMealDB](https://www.themealdb.com/)'s free API (about 300 recipes, mostly classic dishes). The public test key is meant for personal and educational use.
- **Photo scanning** loads Tesseract.js from jsDelivr the first time it's used, so the first scan needs a connection.
- **Data lives in `localStorage`** on each device. Use Export/Import backup to move it between devices.
